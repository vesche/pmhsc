Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but 
Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even 
smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were 
old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he 
was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green 
eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape 
because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only 
thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his 
forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as 
long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever 
remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.
